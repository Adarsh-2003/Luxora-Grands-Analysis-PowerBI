## ❓ Problem Statement

Luxora Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Luxora Grands are losing their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Luxora Grands wanted to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. Their revenue management team decided to hire a third-party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

It includes information on guest bookings, room occupancy, revenue, and key performance indicators across different properties and time periods.
