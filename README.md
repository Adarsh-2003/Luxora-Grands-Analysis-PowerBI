## Problem Statement

Luxora Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Luxora Grands are losing their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Luxora Grands wanted to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. Their revenue management team decided to hire a third-party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## ETL (Extract Tranform & Load)

The ETL pipeline ensured the data was clean and analysis-ready.

### **Extract**
- Data was sourced from CSV files containing property records and other hotel-related details.

### **Transform**
🔹 Removed duplicates to ensure unique records for properties.  
🔹 Handled missing values in critical columns such as `category` and `city` by using business logic.  
🔹 Standardized column names for consistency (e.g., renaming columns to lowercase with underscores).  
🔹 Corrected inconsistent city names (e.g., "Banglore" was corrected to "Bangalore").  
🔹 Added a calculated column to track the count of properties grouped by city.  
🔹 Removed the `day_type` column as it incorrectly classified weekends (Sunday and Saturday were marked as weekends instead of Friday and Saturday).  
🔹 Re-created the `day_type` column using a calculated formula to align with industry standards.  
    - Days classified as **Weekday**: Monday to Thursday.  
    - Days classified as **Weekend**: Friday and Saturday.  
🔹 Selected the "Use First Row as Headers" option to ensure proper column naming.  
🔹 Standardized column names across datasets and ensured proper data types for date and numerical columns.

### **Load**
- The transformed data was imported into Power BI for visualization and creating insights.
